# PrepForOopExam
Hello everyone! 
 
I assume that you're currently studying for your OOP exam and you are probably tired from exerice 5 ,

don't know how or from where to get all the needed information.

ME TOO! 

so that's why I thought it can be good idea to create this repo and let EVERYONE share his/her favorite youtube playlist, website or any useful OOP related content.

The rules are simple:

1.

2.

3. Enjoy

Feel free to contribute! ðŸ’»

# Basic OOP terminology
## Object, Class, Instance, Attributes
   - [Object](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/classes-objects-java/) 
   
      It is a basic unit of Object-Oriented Programming and represents the real life entities.
      An object consists of : 
      State: It is represented by attributes of an object. It also reflects the properties of an object.
      Behavior: It is represented by methods of an object. It also reflects the response of an object with other objects.
      Identity: It gives a unique name to an object and enables one object to interact with other objects.
